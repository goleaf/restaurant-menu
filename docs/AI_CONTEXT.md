# AI Context

This file is the working memory for coding agents. Read it before each prompt and update it after each completed step.

## Current Stack

- Laravel 13.13
- PHP 8.5
- Livewire 4.3
- Flux UI Free 2.14
- Blade server-rendered UI
- SQLite only
- Database cache
- Database sessions
- Database queue
- Local public storage in `storage/app/public`
- Pest 4
- Vite / Tailwind CSS 4

## Main Business Rules

- The product is a SaaS platform for restaurants, cafes, bars, hotels, food courts, and similar venues.
- It must grow beyond a simple QR menu, but each prompt must stay small.
- One physical table / place / service point will eventually have one permanent QR code.
- QR links must not expose restaurant IDs, branch IDs, table IDs, or table numbers.
- Orders must require waiter confirmation by default.
- New guests must require approval by default.
- Branch realtime behavior must use Livewire polling, not WebSockets.

## What Is Already Done

- Laravel + Livewire project foundation.
- SQLite-only database configuration.
- Database-backed cache, sessions, and queues.
- Guest, auth, restaurant dashboard, and superadmin dashboard layout zones.
- Fortify-backed authentication.
- Fixed system roles.
- Flexible permissions with role permissions and user overrides.
- Organizations.
- Organization user memberships.
- Brands.
- Branches.
- Branch settings.

No menu, QR, service point, guest session, order draft, kitchen, bar, payment, or analytics logic has been implemented yet.

## Current Domain Model

Organization:

- Represents the company or owner of a restaurant business.
- Has many brands.
- Has many branches.
- Has many users through `organization_users`.

Brand:

- Belongs to an organization.
- Has many branches.

Branch:

- Belongs to a brand and an organization.
- Is the current working unit for future menu, zones, service points, and orders.
- Has one settings record.

Branch settings:

- Stored in `branch_settings`.
- Created with each new branch.
- Safely created on the settings page for existing branches that do not have settings yet.

## Branch Settings Defaults

- `require_waiter_confirmation_for_orders`: true
- `allow_guest_created_sessions`: true
- `allow_waiter_opened_sessions`: true
- `allow_guest_invite_links`: true
- `guest_join_requires_approval`: true
- `polling_interval_seconds`: 1
- `default_language`: `en`
- `default_currency`: branch currency, or `EUR`
- `service_charge_enabled`: false
- `tips_enabled`: false
- `order_flow_mode`: `waiter_confirmation`

## Routes

- `GET /` -> `home`
- `GET /guest` -> `guest.home`
- `GET /dashboard` -> `dashboard`
- `GET /organizations` -> `organizations.index`
- `GET /organizations/{organization}/brands` -> `organizations.brands.index`
- `GET /organizations/{organization}/brands/{brand}/branches` -> `organizations.brands.branches.index`
- `GET /organizations/{organization}/brands/{brand}/branches/{branch}/settings` -> `organizations.brands.branches.settings.index`
- `GET /restaurant/dashboard` -> `restaurant.dashboard`
- `GET /superadmin/dashboard` -> `superadmin.dashboard`
- Auth and profile routes are provided by Fortify and `routes/settings.php`.

## Livewire Components

- `App\Livewire\Organizations\Index`
- `App\Livewire\Organizations\Brands\Index`
- `App\Livewire\Organizations\Brands\Branches\Index`
- `App\Livewire\Organizations\Brands\Branches\Settings`
- `App\Livewire\Settings\Profile`
- `App\Livewire\Settings\Security`
- `App\Livewire\Settings\Appearance`
- `App\Livewire\Settings\DeleteUserForm`
- `App\Livewire\Settings\TwoFactor\RecoveryCodes`
- `App\Livewire\Actions\Logout`

## Next Step

The next expected product step is likely zones or service points, but only implement it when a prompt explicitly requests it.

## Do Not Break

- Do not rewrite architecture.
- Do not add unrelated future features.
- Do not add Redis, WebSockets, S3, Docker, paid services, React, Vue, Inertia, or a separate SPA.
- Do not expose internal IDs in future QR/public guest URLs.
- Do not remove SQLite support.
- Do not switch cache, sessions, or queues away from database drivers.
- Do not commit `.env`, SQLite database files, `vendor`, `node_modules`, or storage uploads.
- Do not add business logic to Blade templates.
- Do not add raw SQL strings.

## Verification Commands

Use these checks after small changes:

```bash
php artisan migrate --no-interaction
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
php artisan test --compact
npm run build
```

For migration reversibility when a new migration is added:

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1 --no-interaction
php artisan migrate --no-interaction
```
