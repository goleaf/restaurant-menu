# Testing Best Practices

## Preserve the Existing Database Test Lifecycle

This repository applies `RefreshDatabase` to Feature and Browser tests in `tests/Pest.php`, using SQLite `:memory:` by default. Do not replace that lifecycle with `LazilyRefreshDatabase` during unrelated work. File-backed concurrency and backup tests must own isolated temporary database/filesystem paths and cleanup.

## Use Model Assertions Over Raw Database Assertions

Incorrect: `$this->assertDatabaseHas('users', ['id' => $user->id]);`

Correct: `$this->assertModelExists($user);`

More expressive, type-safe, and fails with clearer messages.

## Use Factory States and Sequences

Named states make tests self-documenting. Sequences eliminate repetitive setup.

Incorrect: `User::factory()->create(['email_verified_at' => null]);`

Correct: `User::factory()->unverified()->create();`

## Use `Exceptions::fake()` to Assert Exception Reporting

Instead of `withoutExceptionHandling()`, use `Exceptions::fake()` to assert the correct exception was reported while the request completes normally.

## Call `Event::fake()` After Factory Setup

Model factories rely on model events (e.g., `creating` to generate UUIDs). Calling `Event::fake()` before factory calls silences those events, producing broken models.

Incorrect: `Event::fake(); $user = User::factory()->create();`

Correct: `$user = User::factory()->create(); Event::fake();`

## Use `recycle()` to Share Relationship Instances Across Factories

Without `recycle()`, nested factories create separate instances of the same conceptual entity.

```php
Ticket::factory()
    ->recycle(Airline::factory()->create())
    ->create();
```
